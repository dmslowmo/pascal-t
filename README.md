#Pascal Triangle
---------------
C++ implementation of Pascal Triangle algorithm, with additional 'fun' features:

- Color for the numbers, differentiated by modulo 1 through 7 of each number
- An option to apply modulo on each number in the triangle

Usage: *./pascal-t [no. of levels] [modulo]*

By default, if modulo is unspecified, it uses UINT_MAX value.

The code is written in C++11.
